"@tedcruz Its not being a Small Town Mayor, its just being a small minded lightweight thats acheived nothing during their life. Our important government positions demand qualified, intelligent business minded people with a track record for getting things done. Buttigeig is a complete joke",0
@tedcruz It‚Äôs almost like a weasel that tries to sneak out of town while his constituents are experiencing a life threatening cold weather disaster should not be a Senator,0
"@svoboda_pamela @oheardintherapy @tedcruz That said, there's no comparison. There's no overlap. Two wrongs don't make a right and they never have. Both should be investigated. Both should be held accountable and if wrong doing is found, both should be prosecuted for their crimes. No one is above the law, including POTUS.",0
@Suarez1Pro1977 @tedcruz Ted Cruz really has the nerve to criticize someone else especially when he took off to Cancun while thousands of Texans were freezing with no heat for weeks and some even dying in their homes as a result. Where was the leadership?,0
@DonaldJTrumpJr ** More importantly **  Was Joe Biden REPORTING this ‚ÄúRental Income‚Äù to THE IRS?  I‚Äôm gonna need to see POTUS‚Äô Tax Returns‚Ä¶  So Glad DEMS recently established a Legal Precedent for that!  @mattgaetz @laurenboebert @pnjaban @TuckerCarlson @JackPosobiec @tedcruz @Jim_Jordan,0
@tedcruz @GregAbbott_TX  WHY have you done nothing but whine like bitches about border security? You have not done anything to help. We need an accounting of where all the money went that the Fed gives you #abbotthumantrafficker  #kremlincruz #cancuncruz runs out on Texans,1

@tedcruz Impeach buttigeig,2
"@svoboda_pamela @oheardintherapy @tedcruz I'm sure the special counsel will be addressing these concerns. That's why there's an open investigation. If there is wrong doing found, he should be prosecuted.",0

"True.  Anyone surprised?  He's nothing but a right-wing MAGA Extremist. Which are slowly but surely losing elections...and soon American will tire of all them.  First it was the Tea Party, then MAGA, so what will be their next name? All the same people too - Ted Cruz always one.",2
